            <div class="card-body">
                <p>My name is Abbey Doyle. Iâ€™m a chemical engineer currently working for the Emergency Response Branch of the CDC. After growing up in Kingsport, TN I left to get my undergraduate degree in Chattanooga, TN. There I studied chemical engineering and biology while in the Brock Scholars Program. I completed an undergraduate thesis while researching the pathogenicity of Vibrio cholerae and completed internships and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and Chattem Sanofi. After graduating I began my career as a research chemist at the CDC through Battelle and have worked in the Lung Injury and COVID-19 responses. In my free time I like to backpack, read, run, play the violin or piano, and take my dog to parks.
                Throughout my education and career I learned languages like Python, MATLAB, VBA, Java, C++, and CAD software. I became fascinated with all of the minor differences in softwares that make or break a code and love the challenges that arise when writing a method start to finish.</p>
