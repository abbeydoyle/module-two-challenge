Personal Portfolio

## Description

This project was meant to create an online portfolio that will eventually showcase web applications I develop throughout both this bootcamp and my professional career. As a future web developer, it will be important to have a central location containing some of my work for employers and fellow developers. It will also be key to seeing how far my skills develop as I gain more experience. 

The portfolio, as it currently stands, was developed using only HTML and CSS. This was the first webpage I've created from scratch without the use of any third party developers. Doing this, I learned important skills such as debugging code and the delicate relationships between HTML and CSS.
