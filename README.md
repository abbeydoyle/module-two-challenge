Personal Portfolio

## Description

This project was meant to create an online portfolio that will eventually showcase web applications I develop throughout both this bootcamp and my professional career. As a future web developer, it will be important to have a central location containing some of my work for employers and fellow developers. It will also be key to seeing how far my skills develop as I gain more experience. 

The portfolio, as it currently stands, was developed using only HTML and CSS. This was the first webpage I've created from scratch without the use of any third party developers. Doing this, I learned important skills such as debugging code and the delicate relationships between HTML and CSS.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

<!-- ## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer. -->
